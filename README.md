# World-of-Tomorrow

Build a simple website in which visitors can waste a couple of minutes jotting down their thoughts. 

Using:
- [Font Awesome Icons](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/); 
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/).

### Page Dynamics

User stories allowed by the page: it is possible to 

- establish today's and tomorrow's date;
- create a list of items for today's thoughts;
- catalog ideas for tomorrow;
- open a new page the page and actually do some work.

### Page Structure

The page is divided in the following sections

- navigation bar, fixed at the top of the screen;
- welcome section, greeting the visitor to the page;
- today's section, presenting the visitor with today's date;
- tomorrow's section, presenting the visitor with tomorrow's date;
- footer, pushed at the very bottom of the page.

This structure is achieved through flexbox. 

It allows to move around items freely and change the structure of the page for smaller screen sizes, 
simply by adding flex properties through media queries.
